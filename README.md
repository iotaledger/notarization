## About 

IOTA Notarization is a flexible toolkit that offers multiple methods - such as
Locked Notarization and Dynamic Notarization â€” to securely anchor, update, or
store data on the IOTA ledger.

The current implementation provides Rust libraries and Move smart contracts.

The main source of trust results from the provided Move smart contracts
which are published by the IOTA foundation as package here:
[TODO add Notarization package link here]().

The Rust libraries provide convenience functions to:
* interact with the Notarization Move smart contracts
* query state and meta data information from IOTA nodes and indexers
