-->

## Install the Library

If your project does not contain it already, install the peer dependency `@iota/iota-sdk` as well.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @iota/iota-sdk
```

You can install the latest alpha version of the library by running the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @iota/notarization@alpha
```

## Build the Library

Alternatively, you can build the bindings yourself if you have Rust installed. If not, refer
to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) for the installation.

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (>= `v20`)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (>= 1.65)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) (>= 1.65)
- for running example: a local network node with the IOTA notarization package deployed as being described
  [here](https://docs.iota.org/developer/iota-notarization/single-notarization/getting-started/local-network-setup)

### 1. Install Local Tooling

If you want to build the library from source you have to install additional build tools locally.

#### Install `wasm-bindgen-cli`

First you need to install [`wasm-bindgen-cli`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen).
A manual installation is required because we use the [Weak References](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/reference/weak-references.html) feature,
which [`wasm-pack` does not expose](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/930).

```bash
cargo install --force wasm-bindgen-cli
```

#### Install `wasm-opt`

To reduce the size of the wasm package, it is optimized with `wasm-opt`, which is part of [`binaryen`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen).

You can either download a [release of binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases) and make the bin folder available in your PATH or check if your operating system tooling offers a more convenient way of installing the binaries like APT, Homebrew, etc.

Some examples:

- Linux via APT: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install binaryen` (taken from [here](https://installati.one/install-binaryen-ubuntu-22-04/))
- MacOS via Homebrew: `brew install binaryen` (see [Homebrew entry](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/binaryen))

### 2. Install Dependencies

After installing local tooling, you can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build

You can build the bindings for `node.js` using the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build:nodejs
```

<!--

You can build the bindings for the `web` using the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run build:web
```
